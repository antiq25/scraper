However, my most recent visit left me extremely disappointed and frustrated due to the behavior of one of the staff members, Kim.\n\nAs my friend and I entered the store with our scooters, we were suddenly accosted by Kim, a very rude old lady who aggressively yelled at us to place our scooters at the front. This encounter was completely unexpected, as in all my previous visits, no one, not even the manager, had ever instructed us to do so. Moreover, Kim's tone and attitude were uncalled for and entirely disrespectful.\n\nFeeling disheartened by the unpleasant encounter, my friend and I decided to explore the first floor of the store. To our surprise, we encountered no issues there. The staff on the first floor did not seem to mind us carrying our scooters around, and they treated us with the decency and respect that we deserved as customers.\n\nIt is truly disheartening to encounter such behavior from a staff member, especially in a store that I have regarded highly in the past. Customer service is a vital aspect of any establishment, and the lack of professionalism demonstrated by Kim tarnished the overall experience.\n\nI hope that Canadian Tire takes this feedback seriously and addresses the issue at hand. As a loyal customer, I expect better treatment and respect from the staff, and incidents like these should not be overlooked.\n\nI sincerely hope that my negative experience with Kim was an isolated incident and that Canadian Tire will take appropriate measures to ensure such behavior does not recur in the future.",

Suddenly, the lady spoke to me and said that those are old stocks (which I am aware that it is not). I kind of understood what she was trying to say and I replied politely \"Don't worry about it because I will put everything back once I am done.\"\nShe replied again \"of course I am worried about it because it is our store.\"\nI totally understand where she is coming from. However, how does she expect customers to go through a bin of toys without taking them out of the bin considering there are varieties of hotwheels? It is just disappointing how she treats customers. I am also part of a management and we do not treat our clients like this, she was so unprofessional and I believe she needs more coaching and training. I was not able to get the name the person. I hope Canadian Tire management will do something about it .",

The microwave oven section was half empty but I managed to find a boxed Cuisinart air fryer convention toaster oven in stock as advertised at 50% off along with an additional $50 discount at the checkout! Wow! I also purchased a magic bullet brand personal blender on sale for $29.95. This place is a wonderful store for incredible buys. I come often to purchase specials from their flyers when there are things we need. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. They publish and distribute a flyer every week or every other week depending on the season. This place is advertised as an automotive store but it has so much more to offer with a great selection of housewares, sporting goods and making your home beautiful. Well worth a visit.",
