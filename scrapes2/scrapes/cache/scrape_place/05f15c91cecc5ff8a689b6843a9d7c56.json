I was travelling for 2 months and asked them to freeze my membership but they did that only for one month. I still agreed to pay after they emailed me that my payments are not going through. They failed to tell me that it was their fault that they are not accepting Amex anymore. How would I know till you tell me the reason???? After speaking with 2 different associates at Georgia and Bute location on Oct 14,  I was told that only a manager can do it, and only till7 pm from Mon-Fri. So if I am unable to the gym before 7 pm, essentially I can't cancel the membership?? Are you being serious? Then I asked to downgrade the membership, but again I was told only a manager could do it ..oh wait you also have pay a fee to downgrade...and don't forget only till 7 pm Mon-fri. Help me understand what good are these associates for?? Both associates(Gav and don't know the name of the girl)  were rude, especially the girl who had so much attitude and behaved like she was doing me a huge favour. She said if I'm that busy I could \"phone them\". They were both were mocking clients who were phoning right in front of me to cancel their membership. I could hear them making fun of clients while was doing cardio just a few meters away from the counter.\nNot cool at all.\nI've been their client for a while and I'm genuinely disappointed at their customer service. FW, that's disrespectful to your clients!",
