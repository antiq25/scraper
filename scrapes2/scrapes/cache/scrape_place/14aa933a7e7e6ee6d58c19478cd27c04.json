I recently experimented with some personal training with Mike and can't recommend him enough - he is super knowledgeable, patient, supportive, and knows how to push people really effectively.

He is very diligent, remembers everyone's names and it is clear he is passionate about his job and the members of Fitness World.

What a guy.\n\nI would also recommend getting a PT session from Alex. He was a fountain of knowledge, fixed issues that other PT's in previous gyms have completely missed, really pushed me as hard as I could and was super motivating the whole session. I am training for an Ironman and he was on it with the sports performance side. If I ever had any questions he was always available to message also.\n\nAs cringe as it sounds, I honestly feel so much more confident and happier following only a couple of weeks working with Alex. He also helped with a nutrition plan (which has always been my weak point!).\n\nThanks again Team!\n\nMark",

At first was going for once a week which was fine budget wise but after awhile turned it to two times a week and am seeing better results, like how he teaches the exercises and isn't all that harsh when it comes to pushing through and finishing the reps, going fantastic and always do look forward to the PT sessions with Mike :D",
