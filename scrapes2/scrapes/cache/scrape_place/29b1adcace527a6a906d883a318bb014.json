As it was just to ask a few questions and I had already looked at the items on the shelves, I wasn't too concerned , thinking I would just come back at another time.\n\nThen a little over a week ago, I came in and desperately tried to get staff to help me upstairs, but I got the \"not my department\" response. With one kid simply waving and saying \" over there and saying I can't help you you've got to talk to somebody over there\". In fact, he was pretty rude about it.\n\nat this point since I couldn't reach the person in Kitchen and bathroom design, I thought I would try emailing her. - I found her card on her desk in the kitchen and bathroom design section. Regrettably, she did not respond to my email  nor my phone call. So I escalated to management.\n\nI got a callback from a manager and he set up an appointment for this past Friday which I took time off work for. He even said that he would pop up to the department to make sure everything went smoothly.\n\nSo on Friday I showed up at the 2 o'clock scheduled appointment  only to find that both the person I was supposed to meet and the assistant manager.we're both off that day.\n\nI'm done with Home Depot.",
