You ask for assistance and every time they say wait for a minutes then never show up. I have to ask 3-4 different staffs and if you are lucky, you'll get help after waiting for at least 30 minutes. Usually I never post bad reviews but I'm really upset that staff cut my baseboard wrong size yesterday. This guy( bold head, rude) don't even listen to you carefully when I was telling him the size of cuts. Now what? I have to go back to customer service and explain what happen for refund and redone another cut? How much I have to waste my time to get my job done with this Home Depot.I  spend so much money but this Home Depot screw you up.",

You ask for assistance and every time they say wait for a minutes then never show up. I have to ask 3-4 different staffs and if you are lucky, you'll get help after waiting for at least 30 minutes.
