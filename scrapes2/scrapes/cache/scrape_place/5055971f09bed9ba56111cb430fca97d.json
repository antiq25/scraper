I love the scenery and the background music as I went through the walk-a-lator. Good call on that!

I purchased a product that turned out to be defective just a day after purchase. Naturally, I returned to the store to request a refund or exchange.\nHowever, neither the supervisor nor the managers were willing to process the return simply because the packaging was open. This was perplexing as I had to open the packaging to use the product in the first place. When I asked for an exchange, I was informed that they did not have the item in stock.\nInstead of offering a satisfactory solution, they suggested that I purchase other items that I had no need for. The situation escalated to the point where they threatened to call the police and forcibly removed me from the store. To add insult to injury, my shopping was thrown towards me and then out of the store.\nThis experience has left me feeling extremely upset and disrespected. I strongly discourage anyone from shopping at this store due to their poor customer service and lack of understanding towards customers' rights.",

I get it, you don't need any discernible skill to be a stock boy, but THE LEAST you could do is act like you like your job and be pleasant to customers.
