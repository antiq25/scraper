The technicians doesn't seem to know what they're doing, they tried fixing it when I brought it back but look at the place! How can any work be done in this setting. Standards have really fallen, just a year ago it was decent and had some helpful workers who were knowledgeable. Even helped my husband fix his personal lawn mower. But I haven't seen those workers in a while sadly.",
