So recently I've booked a free one day pass and really looking forward.After 1hr drive from where i live to UBC golds gym( they have four locations, UBC,west broadway. Langley and another i couldn't remember). I planned to go for a run after work out so i chose ubc one. Ok direct to the point now. I was told unfortunately I'm not allowed to work out here cuz i don't live near by within 10km or you can become the membership with us then i asked them to prove that regulation cuz i wouldn't even come if i saw this information. Then they showed me a sentence on the website says must be local resident. Please tell me how to define LOCAL. No matter which location i chose will be out of 10km. At the end i was told either pay 15 bucks or leave. Really don't wanna ruined my day so i paid. Booked a one day free pass turns out been charged. Hilarious. Besides that. All the equipments are super old. Oldies but not goodies.",
