It was stated on the order confirmation email that the tires will be ready for pick up between Nov 2 and Nov 5. Tires were not ready for pick up until Nov 13. This was extremely frustrating.\n\nSecond issue was that I followed the Curbside Pickup workflow via the platform and on the webpage it said that my order was being prepared and that I was 4th in line. Just out of sheer luck, I had to use the washroom and decided to follow up on my order before walking back to my car. This is when the guy at the Automotive Parts counter told me that customers who bought tires cannot opt in for Curbside Pickup.\n\nIf this is the case then there is a bug on the platform and should therefore be fixed. If this is not true then shame on your staff for not providing proper customer service.\n\nFrustrating customer experience to say the least!",

            "review_text": "Placed an order for a new set of all weather tires on Nov 1st. It was stated on the order confirmation email that the tires will be ready for pick up between Nov 2 and Nov 5. Tires were not ready for pick up until Nov 13. This was extremely frustrating.\n\nSecond issue was that I followed the Curbside Pickup workflow via the platform and on the webpage it said that my order was being prepared and that I was 4th in line. Just out of sheer luck, I had to use the washroom and decided to follow up on my order before walking back to my car. This is when the guy at the Automotive Parts counter told me that customers who bought tires cannot opt in for Curbside Pickup.\n\nIf this is the case then there is a bug on the platform and should therefore be fixed. If this is not true then shame on your staff for not providing proper customer service.\n\nFrustrating customer experience to say the least!",

It's unfortunate to see such a decline in customer service, especially in a place like Canadian Tire, which has always been a go-to for many Canadians. I had always held the store in high regard, but this incident has made me reconsider future visits.\n\nWhile everyone can have a bad day, the blatant disregard and subsequent rudeness were beyond justifiable.
