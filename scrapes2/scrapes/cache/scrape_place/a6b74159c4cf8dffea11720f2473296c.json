I had to call and report this to Elafon; they apologized and sent out an emergency repair order, then charged me for both visits. I was appalled! When I called the company to understand this additional charge, they claimed the new leak was a \"coincidence,\" denied their responsibility, and justified the charge. The workmanship was poor, and honestly, the sink was working better before the 2nd fix (in which they must have tightened things too much and the lever to the sink was extremely stiff).

Elafon s technician attended your suite on August 5th, where he found the source of the leak to be a loose spray head hose connection. The technical removed the spray head, cleaned, tightened, and tested and found no other issues at that time besides that your garburator was jammed, and after trying to clear the jam, he was not given authorization from you or your boyfriend to replace the garburator.\nAugust 10th, you made the phone call, and we dispatched a technician, and he found the leak to be coming from your actual faucet cartridge, a completely different leak from the original. He disassembled, cleaned, and restored it to service without further issues.\nFrom what Elafon determined, there were two different leaks and service calls.\nI would have credited the call if the second call were a warranty issue. Unfortunately, it was not.\nSincerely Owner",

That was two years ago and one of the best decisions made. Evan and Bryan have high standards and take pride in their work as do all the plumbers I have met who work for them. They solved long standing problems that the last company could not figure out. I know because I witnessed it in person so it wasn't them just saying it.\nI also know that they are very particular about the employees who represent them and that is how they keep the standards so high. Big thumbs up.",

The first time around they serviced the unit, the technician said that if the problem persists they need to come back and take the unit off-premises for repair at their shops.  The second time they were called, it was with the understanding that they would take the unit off-premises for repair, like their technician had advised the first time.  However, they only changed the filter the second time around and never took the unit for repair.  They charged me close to $300 for changing a filter.  I complained about this and they never owned up to the fact that the initial technician had advised differently and they said that I had to pay the two hour minimum (all this for a filter change).  They claimed that the second technician took the unit apart for service, however according to my tenant who was present, he only changed the filter.  After a-lot of back and forth they gave me a $30 discount (so overly generous of them)!!!!!  DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY.  THEY ARE A BUNCH OF UNPROFESSIONAL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OUT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CUSTOMERS.",

The technician arrived on site checked the heat pump operation and found the only issue was a plugged filter. This warranted the heat pump not being pulled and brought off-site, which would have cost you more than the two-hour service call. Since the service, you have gone through two heat spells without issues with the heat pump operation. Elafon also provided you with a seniors discount to offset your invoice.\nI'm sorry you feel the way you do, but in closing, Elafon provided service, repaired your problem, and provided you with a discount.\nElafon is not in the business of ripping people off we went out of our way to help you, and in the end, fairy resolved this issue.\n\nSincerely Owner",
