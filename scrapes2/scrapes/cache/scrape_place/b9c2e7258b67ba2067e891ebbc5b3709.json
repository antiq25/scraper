My husband and I stopped by to purchase some items, including supplies for his coworkers. We paid separately at the self-checkout, and my husband also exchanged a measuring tape, which he started using right away, given his construction outfit.\n\nAs we headed towards the exit on the first floor where we had parked our car, the security guard requested to see our receipts.

He meticulously counted the pens and scrutinized the bills.\n\nWhat baffled us was when he asked my husband to remove his jacket. We complied, revealing the six bills we had presented earlier, everything perfectly in order. He cited it as a company policy, but was it really necessary to ask about the jacket? Did they have to count the pens too? It felt excessive and, frankly, quite ridiculous.\n\nWe had just spent $100 in the store that day, but this experience was far from pleasant. We used to be regular customers, but today's incident was beyond embarrassing. It's frustrating when you consider the prevalent issue of theft, especially by homeless individuals, and it was clear we weren't the ones they should be concerned about. Regrettably, I have no intention of returning to this store.

We will review our security procedures and provide additional training to our staff to ensure that such incidents are avoided in the future.\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention, and we appreciate your understanding.
