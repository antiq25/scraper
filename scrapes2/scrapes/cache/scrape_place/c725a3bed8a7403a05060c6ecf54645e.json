            "review_text": "Another amazing experience at Home Depot Terminal (Vancouver). I had a very complicated return, 3 items, and 3 different scenarios, but Nifemi handled it perfectly! She investigated, got to the bottom of it, and was a rockstar through it all. A manager had to come in and help, and he was great as well. This is not my closest Home Depot, but I will go out of my way to come here. Every single staff member I deal with is awesome, with a huge care meter and so willing to help. You can tell this store is managed well!",

They have a wide selection to choose from.\n\nThe only down side was when we received our Fridge, there was 2 small dents; one on each side of the french doors.\nSid Moosavi, that works in appliances was the one that helped us from the time of purchase. He was very helpful and resolved the issue immediately.\n\nI enjoyed the experience of purchasing with Home Depot.\n10/10 would recommend and will definitely purchase at this location again.",
