I am truly sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with the brake job and subsequent service you received, and I am here to assist you in resolving this issue.\n\nUpon reviewing our records, I could not find any recent history of the service you are referring to in your review. The last record on file is from over two years ago. During that service, there were no charges for fixing a power steering leak. Instead,  we charged $39.99 for an inspection, and the rest of the services were performed at no charge. This included cleaning the power steering lines and reservoir, finding a leak from a loose clamp, tightening it, and asking to monitor the situation as no further leaks were noticed at that time.\n\nIf this is not the work order you are referencing in your review, could you please reach out to us and provide more details on the specific concerns you have? We want to ensure that we address the right issue and take the necessary steps to make things right.\n\nWe value your business and are committed to addressing your concerns to ensure your satisfaction.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohnny Ray Ritchie\nOperations Manager\nCanadian Tire Auto Service\n604-707-2291",
