I am third in line and both of the customer before me got treated badly. When it's my turn. I was treated the same way also. I was just inquiring about a tire and he was being rude to me also. It put me in a bad mood today. Hopefully this guy changed his behavior towards his customer. I am a former employee of this branch under peter house ownership. If nothing can be done the next time I will be treated rudely I will go early in the morning just to talk to the owner now while they are having a morning huddle.",
