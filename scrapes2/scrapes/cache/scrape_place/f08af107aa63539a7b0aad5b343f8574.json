Staff encouraged you to buy your own clips.\n\nI think it encourages the normalization of poor safety habits in the gym.

This is just asking for an injury, which at this point is a matter of time.\n\nOverall, the people there are nice and helpful. The gym is located in a nice area, close to skytrain and buses. The selection of equipment is pretty good. It does, however, get really crowded, which can be really frustrating as it can take a lot of time to just wait for the equipment and even just finding enough room to perform exercise like lunges etc. The smell can also be.. not the best.. But again, that is what you would expect with a high ratio of people per square meter. It is what you get with cheaper gyms, you get what you pay for.",

They will charge you money for an additional month and not relay the message that you called earlier.\n\nAdditionally, personal training is very transactional. I dislike that they test your fitness level and issues in front of EVERYONE at the gym. Less than kind when delivering your fitness issues and what needs improvement. They're willing to help you IF you dish out the cash.  Wasn't impressed with my personal training experience especially after having a traumatic personal health issue happen prior to building the courage to attend the gym. Go to a community center gym.",
