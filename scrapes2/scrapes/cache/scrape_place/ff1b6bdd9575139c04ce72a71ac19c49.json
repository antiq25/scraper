He's a genuine guy that won't beat around the bush - his straightforward demeanor and approach to training makes working out with him effective. It's refreshing to see a PT with real passion behind his work and it absolutely shows in what he puts on the table and the energy he brings to sessions ",

When I made a mistake while counting reps during one of the exercises, he straight up said \"wow, you\nsuck at math\". How encouraging!\n\n3. Being new to fitness, I asked him if I could wear weightlifting gloves to ease  the pain from my calluses and he proceeded to tell me, \"that's kind of embarrassing cause you're lifting light weights\"\n\n4. The cherry on top of this is that he was unable to physically perform some of the exercises he was showing me how to do. Surely being fit and in shape is the most basic fundamental requirement to being a personal trainer?\n\nI would encourage all women (and those new to fitness) to stay clear from this incredibly unpleasant human being",
