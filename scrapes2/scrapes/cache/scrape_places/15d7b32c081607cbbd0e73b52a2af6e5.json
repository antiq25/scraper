He told me the aisle where it was, but his attitude was like I was really putting him out by *GASP* asking him to do his job.\n\nWent to the aisle, item wasn't there, asking Employee #2, I asked him where said item was, he was looking through a  flyer intently, and again, his attitude was like \"how dare you ask me a question!?\" He muttered something and just pointed to the wall, I said I was looking for a specific item, he goes \"those ARE them\" (they were intact NOT them)  he had a major attitude with me, is this how kids act these days? I get it, you don't need any discernible skill to be a stock boy, but THE LEAST you could do is act like you like your job and be pleasant to customers. I would think that, that is the the bare minimum your hiring manager would want you to do, for your minimum wage job.\n\nEmployee #1 was a tall young man, fair hair and light eyes restocking in the tools section 230 ish November 4th, Employee #2 was \"Jack\" working the bike counter.",

However, my most recent visit left me extremely disappointed and frustrated due to the behavior of one of the staff members, Kim.\n\nAs my friend and I entered the store with our scooters, we were suddenly accosted by Kim, a very rude old lady who aggressively yelled at us to place our scooters at the front. This encounter was completely unexpected, as in all my previous visits, no one, not even the manager, had ever instructed us to do so. Moreover, Kim's tone and attitude were uncalled for and entirely disrespectful.\n\nFeeling disheartened by the unpleasant encounter, my friend and I decided to explore the first floor of the store. To our surprise, we encountered no issues there. The staff on the first floor did not seem to mind us carrying our scooters around, and they treated us with the decency and respect that we deserved as customers.\n\nIt is truly disheartening to encounter such behavior from a staff member, especially in a store that I have regarded highly in the past. Customer service is a vital aspect of any establishment, and the lack of professionalism demonstrated by Kim tarnished the overall experience.\n\nI hope that Canadian Tire takes this feedback seriously and addresses the issue at hand. As a loyal customer, I expect better treatment and respect from the staff, and incidents like these should not be overlooked.\n\nI sincerely hope that my negative experience with Kim was an isolated incident and that Canadian Tire will take appropriate measures to ensure such behavior does not recur in the future.",

I came to see the two household appliances that were advertised and scored excellent buys. Brightly lit aisles and well stocked displays. The microwave oven section was half empty but I managed to find a boxed Cuisinart air fryer convention toaster oven in stock as advertised at 50% off along with an additional $50 discount at the checkout! Wow! I also purchased a magic bullet brand personal blender on sale for $29.95. This place is a wonderful store for incredible buys. I come often to purchase specials from their flyers when there are things we need. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. They publish and distribute a flyer every week or every other week depending on the season. This place is advertised as an automotive store but it has so much more to offer with a great selection of housewares, sporting goods and making your home beautiful. Well worth a visit.",

The wrecking bars were put in place of different wrecking bar (same size but different material) where the sticker price was half of the original price. I didn't notice while paying. When i came back thinking i got overcharged, the customer service girl was quite rude. Didn't even try to find my order. Manager found my order and told that girl, the product number that was charged, over the phone. She told me that i bought another item than the one i was claiming. I told her that there was some mistake and asked her to come with me to the stall from where i picked from, to which she said, it's not her work. Then i went and took a picture of the sticker price and showed it to her. Then she just said, no you are showing me the wrong picture. I again asked her to come with me to the stall to which she refused again. Kept on asking me what i need her to do. I asked to refund the difference. Mind that, i still don't know that i purchased wrong item because of their fault. Then i asked for manager. Manager promptly came and i asked him to come with me. He noticed the wrong label and told me what had happened. The customer service girl experience was the first time i was met with such hostility. Not coming back to this location.",

The last record on file is from over two years ago. During that service, there were no charges for fixing a power steering leak. Instead,  we charged $39.99 for an inspection, and the rest of the services were performed at no charge. This included cleaning the power steering lines and reservoir, finding a leak from a loose clamp, tightening it, and asking to monitor the situation as no further leaks were noticed at that time.\n\nIf this is not the work order you are referencing in your review, could you please reach out to us and provide more details on the specific concerns you have? We want to ensure that we address the right issue and take the necessary steps to make things right.\n\nWe value your business and are committed to addressing your concerns to ensure your satisfaction.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJohnny Ray Ritchie\nOperations Manager\nCanadian Tire Auto Service\n604-707-2291",
