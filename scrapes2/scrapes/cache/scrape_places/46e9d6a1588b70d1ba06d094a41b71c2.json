I give Mr.Kireeti a 0/10 review in terms of taking care of the customer avoid him at all times. After giving me a hard time picking up my order he refused to call another supervisor and told me he is the boss here and he's not going to give me my pre paid order keeping me waiting for 50 minutes he still did not apologize. I love shopping at The Home Depot but unfortunately after my interaction with Mr.Kireeti I feel sorry for the company that has chosen such unprofessional and childish person to represent their business. Not only I'm not satisfied but I'm disappointed in the training process and how the management team is being such bad role models for the other employees.",

It's clearly he's not helping to go over the inventory and go to his break instead without let the customer know. And even with him comeback , I asked him did you find the items he just run off said there's a line up etc. that's totally disappointing and disrespect.  But I did have another staff help me out and get me a discount on the item. Not a very good shopping experience .",

It's clearly he's not helping to go over the inventory and go to his break instead without let the customer know. And even with him comeback , I asked him did you find the items he just run off said there's a line up etc. that's totally disappointing and disrespect.  But I did have another staff help me out and get me a discount on the item. Not a very good shopping experience .",

As it was just to ask a few questions and I had already looked at the items on the shelves, I wasn't too concerned , thinking I would just come back at another time.\n\nThen a little over a week ago, I came in and desperately tried to get staff to help me upstairs, but I got the \"not my department\" response. With one kid simply waving and saying \" over there and saying I can't help you you've got to talk to somebody over there\". In fact, he was pretty rude about it.\n\nat this point since I couldn't reach the person in Kitchen and bathroom design, I thought I would try emailing her. - I found her card on her desk in the kitchen and bathroom design section. Regrettably, she did not respond to my email  nor my phone call. So I escalated to management.\n\nI got a callback from a manager and he set up an appointment for this past Friday which I took time off work for. He even said that he would pop up to the department to make sure everything went smoothly.\n\nSo on Friday I showed up at the 2 o'clock scheduled appointment  only to find that both the person I was supposed to meet and the assistant manager.we're both off that day.\n\nI'm done with Home Depot.",

Usually I never post bad reviews but I'm really upset that staff cut my baseboard wrong size yesterday. This guy( bold head, rude) don't even listen to you carefully when I was telling him the size of cuts. Now what? I have to go back to customer service and explain what happen for refund and redone another cut? How much I have to waste my time to get my job done with this Home Depot.I  spend so much money but this Home Depot screw you up.",
