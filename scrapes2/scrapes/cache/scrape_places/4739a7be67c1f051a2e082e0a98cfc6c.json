It's great they have a women's only section that is well equipped.\nHowever the way they get you to join is by pressuring you with deals. They advertise a '3 day free trial' but that's not really true, since you have to have a whole meeting about the gym and prices before you can try it, and then they'll hound you with deals you can only have if you join before working out. I wanted to actually try the gym before committing, but felt really pressured by this meeting (with Farah) and left with a bad taste in my mouth.\nI signed up for 3 months to see if it was worth the price (around $72 per month). It's a good gym with lots of equipment and always pretty clean. It's never crazy busy either and other people here are friendly and just focused on their workout. The classes system is confusing as you have to pay extra for some of them and the booking on my app never worked, so I didn't try the classes.\n\nThey don't seem to pay much attention to the bathrooms as the women's was frequently out of toilet paper.\n\nTheir customer service is only contactable by email and they take over a week to reply, or just don't reply. This is really annoying when you want to freeze your membership or do other things that the front desk can't do.\n\nOverall, I like this gym but they need to change the way they recruit new members. If it was a fixed price a month without all the fees and commitments I would probably stay. But the hassle and pressure isn't worth it for me, I'd rather go to a gym where it's the same price every month and they're not just trying to get your money.",

So recently I've booked a free one day pass and really looking forward.After 1hr drive from where i live to UBC golds gym( they have four locations, UBC,west broadway. Langley and another i couldn't remember). I planned to go for a run after work out so i chose ubc one. Ok direct to the point now. I was told unfortunately I'm not allowed to work out here cuz i don't live near by within 10km or you can become the membership with us then i asked them to prove that regulation cuz i wouldn't even come if i saw this information. Then they showed me a sentence on the website says must be local resident. Please tell me how to define LOCAL. No matter which location i chose will be out of 10km. At the end i was told either pay 15 bucks or leave. Really don't wanna ruined my day so i paid. Booked a one day free pass turns out been charged. Hilarious. Besides that.
