It's great they have a women's only section that is well equipped.\nHowever the way they get you to join is by pressuring you with deals. They advertise a '3 day free trial' but that's not really true, since you have to have a whole meeting about the gym and prices before you can try it, and then they'll hound you with deals you can only have if you join before working out. I wanted to actually try the gym before committing, but felt really pressured by this meeting (with Farah) and left with a bad taste in my mouth.\nI signed up for 3 months to see if it was worth the price (around $72 per month). It's a good gym with lots of equipment and always pretty clean. It's never crazy busy either and other people here are friendly and just focused on their workout. The classes system is confusing as you have to pay extra for some of them and the booking on my app never worked, so I didn't try the classes.\n\nThey don't seem to pay much attention to the bathrooms as the women's was frequently out of toilet paper.\n\nTheir customer service is only contactable by email and they take over a week to reply, or just don't reply. This is really annoying when you want to freeze your membership or do other things that the front desk can't do.\n\nOverall, I like this gym but they need to change the way they recruit new members. If it was a fixed price a month without all the fees and commitments I would probably stay. But the hassle and pressure isn't worth it for me, I'd rather go to a gym where it's the same price every month and they're not just trying to get your money.",

This is just asking for an injury, which at this point is a matter of time.\n\nOverall, the people there are nice and helpful. The gym is located in a nice area, close to skytrain and buses. The selection of equipment is pretty good. It does, however, get really crowded, which can be really frustrating as it can take a lot of time to just wait for the equipment and even just finding enough room to perform exercise like lunges etc. The smell can also be.. not the best.. But again, that is what you would expect with a high ratio of people per square meter. It is what you get with cheaper gyms, you get what you pay for.",

Lucas and Shush usually manning the front door are helpful as hell and super dope guys.  Sarah and Sam are also so genuine and always happy to see you.

This is a really busy gym but they make sure you feel a part of the community and everyone is super helpful.\n\nBig shout out to Dylan though, he made everything super easy to understand and gave me a great work out plan. I love catching up with him when I see him",

This is a really busy gym but they make sure you feel a part of the community and everyone is super helpful.\n\nBig shout out to Dylan though, he made everything super easy to understand and gave me a great work out plan. I love catching up with him when I see him",

What a guy.\n\nI would also recommend getting a PT session from Alex. He was a fountain of knowledge, fixed issues that other PT's in previous gyms have completely missed, really pushed me as hard as I could and was super motivating the whole session. I am training for an Ironman and he was on it with the sports performance side. If I ever had any questions he was always available to message also.\n\nAs cringe as it sounds, I honestly feel so much more confident and happier following only a couple of weeks working with Alex. He also helped with a nutrition plan (which has always been my weak point!).\n\nThanks again Team!\n\nMark",

                    "review_text": "Great, affordable gym to be working out at. The staff are honestly the friendliest I've met - especially Bennie! What a guy.\n\nI would also recommend getting a PT session from Alex. He was a fountain of knowledge, fixed issues that other PT's in previous gyms have completely missed, really pushed me as hard as I could and was super motivating the whole session. I am training for an Ironman and he was on it with the sports performance side. If I ever had any questions he was always available to message also.\n\nAs cringe as it sounds, I honestly feel so much more confident and happier following only a couple of weeks working with Alex. He also helped with a nutrition plan (which has always been my weak point!).\n\nThanks again Team!\n\nMark",

It's hard waiting around until after the previous class creeps into the next class time and then your class ends later as a result.\nIt's steadily been a problem for Thursday evenings where we're waiting for dance class and the class beforehand (I think it's More Core?) always goes til 7:15 when the next class is supposed to start.\nOther than that, great bang for your buck. Keep it up FW :)",

So if I am unable to the gym before 7 pm, essentially I can't cancel the membership?? Are you being serious? Then I asked to downgrade the membership, but again I was told only a manager could do it ..oh wait you also have pay a fee to downgrade...and don't forget only till 7 pm Mon-fri. Help me understand what good are these associates for?? Both associates(Gav and don't know the name of the girl)  were rude, especially the girl who had so much attitude and behaved like she was doing me a huge favour. She said if I'm that busy I could \"phone them\". They were both were mocking clients who were phoning right in front of me to cancel their membership.
