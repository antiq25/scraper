            "review_text": "Honestly, the gym is as good as any other place. You can get premium gym membership at other places but the equipment will still be the same. The treadmills, weights, and squat racks are going to be manufactured by the same small handful of companies anyways. The draw back to this gym is as other reviews mentioned, overcrowding. If you logically think about it this location in comparison to other fitness worlds is positioned at the most lucrative spot. A transit and sky train intersection. It is an inevitability that there will be more people at this gym than other places. Once you do the cost benefit analysis, it s not all that surprising. The solution is simply to ask other people to swap in with you during workouts. Most are quite friendly thus not decline and once you get into the habit of this, your gym routine will be on schedule as usual in my personal experience. No delays.",

After 4pm youre in for chaos but if youre into that, you do you! Also, personal trainers are a whole new level. Gustavo Chivata was just an amazing trainer. He taught me good posture, breathing rythm, pacing myself, pairing machines with other workouts, and he was just so approachable. I really recommend the free session and I also took the 5 sessions, trust me it does make a difference. Gus was a breeze to work with and also spoke Spanish, which was a plus to me.",
