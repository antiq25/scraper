She investigated, got to the bottom of it, and was a rockstar through it all. A manager had to come in and help, and he was great as well. This is not my closest Home Depot, but I will go out of my way to come here. Every single staff member I deal with is awesome, with a huge care meter and so willing to help. You can tell this store is managed well!",

The only down side was when we received our Fridge, there was 2 small dents; one on each side of the french doors. Sid Moosavi, that works in appliances was the one that helped us from the time of purchase. He was very helpful and resolved the issue immediately. I enjoyed the experience of purchasing with Home Depot. 10/10 would recommend and will definitely purchase at this location again.",

Took it back to home depot and also brought my cabinets in with me and explained the situation to Ken Nguey and Saksham. They quickly identified that I needed a much stronger staple gun to perform the repair so instead of charging me for one, they took one from the rental section and helped me repair my shelves on the spot as it required an air compressor which i didnt have access to either. My shelves are fully repaired now and I am extremely happy with the service I received. Keep up the good work guys!",
