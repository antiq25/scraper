When I couldnt find the desired 24 x 48 corrugated plastic sheets due to their unavailability, Scott came to my rescue. Despite only having larger 48 x 96 sheets in stock, he willingly offered to cut one in half for me, even though I didnt have any tools with me. Scotts helpfulness was refreshing, especially after encountering three other unhelpful employees. As my young daughter astutely pointed out, Scott was the only staff member who made us feel truly welcome. The management team at Home Depot should acknowledge and appreciate employees like Scott, as his outstanding customer service sets an example for his peers to follow.",
