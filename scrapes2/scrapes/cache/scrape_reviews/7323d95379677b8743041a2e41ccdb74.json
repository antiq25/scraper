Golds BC offered me a good deal in May for multi-access across all Golds Gyms in BC, which would activate once the gyms were allowed to reopen. I first used the West Broadway facility before the UBC location reopened. The UBC location is great. It has everything I need. The staff are friendly. Not hard to register a spot (right now you need to make a reservation to workout), since the location isnt crowded. I think the company is doing pretty good considering the circumstances.",

He makes it easy to understand the reasons for each exercise and the metrics for keeping track of progress. He also has very clear explanations for correcting postures and avoiding injuries which are especially important for weight training. I am very happy with the quality of PT provided by Bryan and Golds Gym. As for the gym, it is very clean and offers a wide variety of equipment.
