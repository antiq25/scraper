I came to see the two household appliances that were advertised and scored excellent buys. Brightly lit aisles and well stocked displays. The microwave oven section was half empty but I managed to find a boxed Cuisinart air fryer convention toaster oven in stock as advertised at 50% off along with an additional $50 discount at the checkout! Wow! I also purchased a magic bullet brand personal blender on sale for $29.95. This place is a wonderful store for incredible buys. I come often to purchase specials from their flyers when there are things we need. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. They publish and distribute a flyer every week or every other week depending on the season. This place is advertised as an automotive store but it has so much more to offer with a great selection of housewares, sporting goods and making your home beautiful. Well worth a visit.",

What I really liked about this location is that they have their patio/outdoor furniture setup and on display. This way you can test out the furniture to see if it s what you were envisioning online. The other CTs don t really do this so this one was great for that. One thing though is this one doesn t have any self checkout stations and there was a huge lineup and only one person jumped on to another cashier to help the one cashier for the longest time.

It s easy to reposition to eye level, and can hold any phone size. After three months of use when the product was super tight in the socket, I had a small issue by pulling the plug out on an angle too fast. Rather than fixing it, I returned it to the store with my triangle card and exchanged it for a new one. They found my receipt by tracking the purchase date. Very satisfied with service and auto accessories!",

I was so lucky to get Connors service. He asked a couple of questions to make sure I did need to change the battery. He even took his time to test the battery for me. When I decided to change the battery, he recommended the reasonable one for me. He also offered me two options to replace it: let their machinists do that for me (charge 68$) or by myself. In order to save the money, I chose to do that by myself.  I asked Connor to lent me the tools and tried it. Unfortunately, it was not as simple as I thought and gave it up, and I turned to the machinists for help, but none of them were available at that moment and asked me to leave my car there and they might replace it tomorrow. I was so disappointed and turned to Connor for help again. By the rule, Connor is not allowed to replace the battery for me, but he still be so nice to stand beside and guide me how to do that properly. With his instructions, I finally replace my battery. To be honest, I bothered Connor so many times today, but he was so patient and offered me the best service all the time! Connor, thank you so much for saving my day!",
