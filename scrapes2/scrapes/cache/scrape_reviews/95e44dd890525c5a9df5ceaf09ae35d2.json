My trainer Dylan Hunt was absolutely fantastic and always checks in on me when he sees me at the gym. This is a really busy gym but they make sure you feel a part of the community and everyone is super helpful. Big shout out to Dylan though, he made everything super easy to understand and gave me a great work out plan. I love catching up with him when I see him",

And on top of physical results, Im seeing strong mental gains as shes constantly reminding me to not give her ALL the credit, as Im dedicated to my own fitness journey, putting in the work, and making changes. Clearly, I highly recommend trying some sessions with Ashley if she has availability!",
