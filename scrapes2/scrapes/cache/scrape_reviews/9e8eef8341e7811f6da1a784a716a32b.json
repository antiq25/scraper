Can be a little busy at times but everyone is pretty respectful. My five star review goes to the trainers, specifically Ryan. During my time training with Ryan hes attentive to my goals and needs and aware of minor adjustments needed to see a change in posture, stance and aesthetics. Highly recommend training with him.",

He knows about nutrition and how to put technique and fun together in a workout session. I was feeling the difference working out with him, his guidance was so much better than group sessions I had with coaches in the past. Another thing I like about my gym is how focused everyone is here when it comes to working out and how nice and friendly the staff is.",

I was given an assessment and a free session when I started my membership. This helped me to make great strides towards my fitness goal.

I planned to hire trainer for only one month but now I have 3 sessions/week with Tarek and planning to extend it to one year as I am feeling my whole body feels stronger and better than before, we are having very productive and effective sessions. Tarek is enthusiastic, encouraging, but most importantly knows what he s doing and has helped me greatly in improving my strength and mobility. If you re looking for a trainer, he s who you should go to! Thanks Fitness world for hiring such great trainers and providing amazing facility to workout. Have a great time",

We come here to work out, not to relax and be pampered. The price is good. The location is good. And 99 percent of the time everything is functional. The location is older, so it is what it is. If you want a brand new sparkling gym youll have to go elsewhere and pay much more. And to one of the other reviewers mentioning guys downstairs grunting or something along those lines: Thats what PEOPLE do (involuntarily) when they exert themselves past their normal limits. You should try it some time. You might see some progress.",
