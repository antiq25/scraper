I have been looking for a patio set for a while but couldnt find anything I like. Once I saw this set , I fell in love and wanted it in my home right away . My car was too small to fit the big box , Yak was able to arrange fast shipping, and I was able to get it the next day . I was not sure about this set, and Yak gave me his honest opinion. The set is high quality  and very comfortable.  I love it.  Thank you, Yak and his team.  Highly recommend homedepot, especially this location.",

Thank you so much to Glenn from the bottom of our heart; Glenn was kind, patient, and helpful everytime my father came into the store to ask questions. It was challenging for my father to converse and speak proper English as English isnt his first language . Glenn didnt just give simple replies; he listened patiently, researched several times and wasnt willing to give up. Finally, he was able to find the exact one for us and gave my father all the information he needed. Thank you for your outstanding customer service Glenn, my father has never met someone as dedicated to customers as you are. You really made his day! I hope your hard work doesnt go unnoticed by the management and the company. Home Depot is lucky to have an employee like you. Thank you thank you thank you we really appreciate you.",

She invested her time and shared her great knowledge to explain to me what tools I needed and how I could better plan. She walked with me to other isles because she was concerned if I can purchase some specific tools. She is patient, knowledgeable, approachable, and caring. She was amazing when it came to communication, collaboration, reliability, work quality, problem-solving, and timeliness. She went above and beyond the call of duty. Thanks to Home Depot for hiring respectful, knowledgeable and professional staff like Suzzane. Hats off to Suzzane.",

I LOVE great service! Feb 22/23 I had to make a return for a client who made an out of province purchase for her dad in Vancouver. I wasnt sure how well this would go. The client called customer service to explain the situation. The returns staff Fred and Mostafa were absolutely amazing, professional, and efficient. Lester helped me move the items from my car to the store. I was in and out of there in less than 15 minutes! I have always been a fan of Home Depot and their great service, but this really took things to another level. Makes me wonder why I/we would ever go anywhere else! Thanks guys you are the best!!",
