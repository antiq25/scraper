They have affordable packages befitting for your goals and plenty of clean and working equipment. However, keep in mind that it is usually crowded at peak times. Staff is friendly and willing to help you, Eve (personal trainers) helped me to identify exercise posture and muscle to be trained on. She was really sweet. Overall, I find this gym functional for workout beginners and experienced people. You can monitor your progress with a personal trainer or with the equipment available.",

I joined at some point in Covid and I was pretty grumpy... and this gym has helped me lose >30 pounds and make some big fitness gains. The manager (Dylan) is fantastic and relentlessly positive, and the staff is generally great. I recently experimented with some personal training with Mike and cant recommend him enough - he is super knowledgeable, patient, supportive, and knows how to push people really effectively. When I can afford training regularly, Ill try to get Mike - just a couple of professional moves away for me:) But my workouts with him were outstanding - highly highly recommend.",

In general, I feel a lot safer in this gym than others I have been to (yay for being a woman  ) because coaches are always around training someone and keeping an eye on things.",

What makes this gym truly stand out are the employees. They put a smile on my face whenever I come to the gym and that is saying a lot since I usually arrive at 6am slightly sleepy and grumpy. Id like to give a big shout out to Benny. He is one of the friendliest people Ive ever met. He is very diligent, remembers everyones names and it is clear he is passionate about his job and the members of Fitness World. Although there are larger gyms in the area, the sense of community Fitness World creates in their gym is unbeatable. Thanks for making all of my workouts such a pleasant experience.",

            "review_text": "Great, affordable gym to be working out at. The staff are honestly the friendliest Ive met - especially Bennie! What a guy. I would also recommend getting a PT session from Alex. He was a fountain of knowledge, fixed issues that other PTs in previous gyms have completely missed, really pushed me as hard as I could and was super motivating the whole session. I am training for an Ironman and he was on it with the sports performance side. If I ever had any questions he was always available to message also. As cringe as it sounds, I honestly feel so much more confident and happier following only a couple of weeks working with Alex. He also helped with a nutrition plan (which has always been my weak point!). Thanks again Team! Mark",

I took the free session with no intention of signing up for a personal trainer, but G blew me away and I felt like all my goals could be achieved with his guidance. I was not disappointed. I had a goal of weight loss for my wedding, but also to gain strength and mobility for my own longevity and quality of life, as I have a physically demanding job. G has kept me focused and on track and I have been amazed with the results I have seen. Overall, not only have I lost weight and feel much more confident in myself, I also had no idea I could get so fit, lift so much weight, and feel so strong! G is a demanding trainer, our sessions together leave me feeling pushed to the limit and amazed at what I have achieved. If you are looking to take it easy look elsewhere. G will push you and you will see results and have a blast at the same time.  He is exceptionally enthusiastic and passionate about his work and it is infectious. He is always available for advice and guidance. I cannot recommend him highly enough and will never have another trainer, I will always train the G way! I thank him for him encouragement and belief in me.",

It can be quite busy at peak times, and I prefer to workout on the turf rooftop when it s nice out. There are currently low-intensity fitness classes with a sweet, helpful instructor. Everyone wears masks in every part of the gym. Happy I joined on the  Fit  membership and after checking out another location, this place will be my go-to.

Their commitment to member satisfaction shines through from the warm and professional welcome at reception to the personalized attention they offer. In the past, Ive experienced gyms where personal trainers appeared to lack expertise, and there was no higher authority to turn to for assistance. Fitness World Cambie, on the other hand, is a refreshing change. The trainers at this location are not just well-informed, but also incredibly supportive and enthusiastic, creating a comfortable and motivating environment for fitness enthusiasts (or newbies) across all levels. One of the standout features of this gym is the tight-knit family vibe and the sense of community they foster. Dylans approachability and his knack for remembering everyones names contribute to this welcoming atmosphere. This location exceeds expectations when it comes to essential factors a gym should have, offering a variety of classes, well-maintained equipment, excellent hygiene and ventilation, and spotless facilities. The diverse fitness options and genuine care demonstrated by the staff make this gym the ideal choice for anyone looking to improve their health and well-being. Whats more, if theres ever an issue, a quick word with Dylan usually resolves it without any fuss. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Fitness World Cambie for its unrivaled service, comprehensive facilities, and the exceptional approachability of the General Manager and team members, all while creating a warm, family-like atmosphere and a strong sense of community.",
