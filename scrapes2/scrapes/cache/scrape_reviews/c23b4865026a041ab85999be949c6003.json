My daughter lives in Vancouver and I called on her behalf and the shop was able to help her out with same-day service. My daughter is a person with a disability, so her vehicle is very important to her as accessible transportation is not always available. The shop was very understanding, very responsive and very helpful. Would definitely go back!  Special thanks to Alex for the exceptional above and beyond service!",

I called in before bringing in my car(flat tire) and was told by the representative that they have the exact same tire on location and provided me the latest time/day it will be finished. That day came and when I called to check if my car is ready, turned out they do not have the tire and will have to be ordered and shipped from a different location. At this point, I was given another day/time when it will be completed. I received a call saying my car is finished, I came back and the car is not ready nor is the tire even on location. No one seems to be taking ownership of the 2 mistakes with the exception of Genesis. He took ownership of the issue and provided me with creative solutions to have the car ready at the time I needed it by. He was able to have my car ready within a very short time frame. We (consumers) need more reps like Genesis. Service: Tires",

The customer staff have always been helpful and courteous. Unlike other shops I had tried before, its nice to see that the staff here take the time to help you from start to finish rather than get interrupted every time someone comes to the counter for a quick question. Definitely recommend this auto shop for anyone who wants to make sure their vehicle is serviced properly.",
