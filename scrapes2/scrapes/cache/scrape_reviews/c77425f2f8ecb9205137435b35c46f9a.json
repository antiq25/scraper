            "review_text": "It was a great service with Canadian tire center! We had a nail on one of our rear tire. We went to costco, bigotire and Mr. lube to get opinions. We were told that we had to replace all 4 tires without even checking. But we just replace a brand new front tire a year ago and only drove less than 3000 Km since. Costco was the worst of all! They were so impatience and told us they had to replace all four tires because they had to be the same brands because they did not carry my tires brand. Their attitude was the worst!  Canadian tire was our last store to get opinion on.  Gensis, Nash and Steven were very helpful and Gensis was very patience with us. He explained a lot of things to us and help us understand the situation. After listening to our story, Gensis told us that they would first check if our tire was repairable then offered options if it was not.  Both Costco and Mr. Lube never even bothered to do what Canadian tire did. They just assumed that we had a nail and all our four tires were needed to be replaced. Gensis at Canadian tire is such a nice guy and a great supervisor/manager I assumed. He went an extra mile for the customer and put our best interest first! As a business owner myself, I really think it is hard to find a great employee like Gensis these days.  In the end, it turned out to be that our tire only needed a patch. It only cost us 70 dollar! At Costco, they quoted us for almost $3000 to replace all tires. We will for sure go back to Canadian for future replacement!  We would 100% recommend this Canadian tire center at Cambie.",

He took down all my details and told me to call him if I needed anything at all.  As someone who worked for two separate Canadian tires for about 3 years, Booth I appreciate you. Customer coming in frantically 30 mins before close? Likely underpaid/undervalued, and definitely overworked?
