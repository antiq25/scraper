Wanted to get colors for our first wooden paint project, the person was really helpful and gave so much detailed knowledge about different types of colors and  what and when to use.

Thanks to him this project is coming out really good We forgot one of the paint bottle at the payment counter but the lady Name Dolly came all the way to parking lot to give the forgotten color. That kind is service is really rear this days. Thanks again The Home Depot Cambie. For such a great experience.",
