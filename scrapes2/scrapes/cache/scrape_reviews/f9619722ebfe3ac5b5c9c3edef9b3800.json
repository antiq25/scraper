            "review_text": "This is a great gym. The staff is very friendly and approachable if you have any questions and feedback on equipment etc. I would give this gym 4.5 stars only because they are missing a few key pieces of equipment but that s only if your the body builder kinda guy. But I did talk to them and they are planning on adding those pieces in the next couple years which is why I gave the 5 stars. One is the pendulum squat machine which is one of the best machines to add on your leg day to really focus on the quads better than any workout you can think of for the quads. The pendulum squat machine is very difficult to find in any gym so the fact that they re adding it is amazing. Another is a standing lateral raise machine, Some call it a Watson machine. Another is the standing T Bar Row, they do have the seated one, but it doesn t put you at the best angle but still workable. All in all a great gym if you can avoid the busy hours. Thank you Golds!!!",

Usually gyms are cash grabs where they oversell memberships and hope people dont show up but I really appreciated this gesture. Gym itself is usually great and not too busy during the weekdays. Has everything you need in a gym and is affordable.",

Bel was such a patient, caring, and highly knowledgeable trainer. She helped me grow my confidence and skills to the point where I am now working out 4x a week and following my own custom plan which she created for me. I cannot recommend Bel and Gold s Gym enough!",
