We went to costco, bigotire and Mr. lube to get opinions. We were told that we had to replace all 4 tires without even checking. But we just replace a brand new front tire a year ago and only drove less than 3000 Km since. Costco was the worst of all! They were so impatience and told us they had to replace all four tires because they had to be the same brands because they did not carry my tires brand. Their attitude was the worst!  Canadian tire was our last store to get opinion on.  Gensis, Nash and Steven were very helpful and Gensis was very patience with us. He explained a lot of things to us and help us understand the situation. After listening to our story, Gensis told us that they would first check if our tire was repairable then offered options if it was not.  Both Costco and Mr. Lube never even bothered to do what Canadian tire did. They just assumed that we had a nail and all our four tires were needed to be replaced. Gensis at Canadian tire is such a nice guy and a great supervisor/manager I assumed. He went an extra mile for the customer and put our best interest first! As a business owner myself, I really think it is hard to find a great employee like Gensis these days.  In the end, it turned out to be that our tire only needed a patch. It only cost us 70 dollar! At Costco, they quoted us for almost $3000 to replace all tires. We will for sure go back to Canadian for future replacement!

ChIJHWzHwvF0hlQRb3btui47PZk,Canadian Tire,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyMC15TjNRRRAB,B Ess,5,HUGE Canadian Tire! Lots of ample parking everywhere and they also have a good selection of live plants at this one but not as good as Cambie. What I really liked about this location is that they have their patio/outdoor furniture setup and on display. This way you can test out the furniture to see if it s what you were envisioning online. The other CTs don t really do this so this one was great for that. One thing though is this one doesn t have any self checkout stations and there was a huge lineup and only one person jumped on to another cashier to help the one cashier for the longest time. I m a fan of self checkouts for this reason.,a year ago,2022-11-18 21:37:18.882970,,,,1,174,676,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116948977329359108677/reviews?entry=ttu,True,,

He even took his time to test the battery for me. When I decided to change the battery, he recommended the reasonable one for me. He also offered me two options to replace it: let their machinists do that for me (charge 68$) or by myself. In order to save the money, I chose to do that by myself.  I asked Connor to lent me the tools and tried it. Unfortunately, it was not as simple as I thought and gave it up, and I turned to the machinists for help, but none of them were available at that moment and asked me to leave my car there and they might replace it tomorrow. I was so disappointed and turned to Connor for help again. By the rule, Connor is not allowed to replace the battery for me, but he still be so nice to stand beside and guide me how to do that properly. With his instructions, I finally replace my battery.

I called in before bringing in my car(flat tire) and was told by the representative that they have the exact same tire on location and provided me the latest time/day it will be finished. That day came and when I called to check if my car is ready, turned out they do not have the tire and will have to be ordered and shipped from a different location. At this point, I was given another day/time when it will be completed. I received a call saying my car is finished, I came back and the car is not ready nor is the tire even on location. No one seems to be taking ownership of the 2 mistakes with the exception of Genesis. He took ownership of the issue and provided me with creative solutions to have the car ready at the time I needed it by. He was able to have my car ready within a very short time frame.
