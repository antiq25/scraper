When I couldnt find the desired 24 x 48 corrugated plastic sheets due to their unavailability, Scott came to my rescue. Despite only having larger 48 x 96 sheets in stock, he willingly offered to cut one in half for me, even though I didnt have any tools with me. Scotts helpfulness was refreshing, especially after encountering three other unhelpful employees. As my young daughter astutely pointed out, Scott was the only staff member who made us feel truly welcome. The management team at Home Depot should acknowledge and appreciate employees like Scott, as his outstanding customer service sets an example for his peers to follow.",

I have been looking for a patio set for a while but couldnt find anything I like. Once I saw this set , I fell in love and wanted it in my home right away . My car was too small to fit the big box , Yak was able to arrange fast shipping, and I was able to get it the next day . I was not sure about this set, and Yak gave me his honest opinion. The set is high quality  and very comfortable.  I love it.  Thank you, Yak and his team.  Highly recommend homedepot, especially this location.",

Thank you so much to Glenn from the bottom of our heart; Glenn was kind, patient, and helpful everytime my father came into the store to ask questions. It was challenging for my father to converse and speak proper English as English isnt his first language . Glenn didnt just give simple replies; he listened patiently, researched several times and wasnt willing to give up. Finally, he was able to find the exact one for us and gave my father all the information he needed. Thank you for your outstanding customer service Glenn, my father has never met someone as dedicated to customers as you are. You really made his day! I hope your hard work doesnt go unnoticed by the management and the company. Home Depot is lucky to have an employee like you. Thank you thank you thank you we really appreciate you.",

The client called customer service to explain the situation. The returns staff Fred and Mostafa were absolutely amazing, professional, and efficient. Lester helped me move the items from my car to the store. I was in and out of there in less than 15 minutes!

I enjoyed the experience of purchasing with Home Depot. 10/10 would recommend and will definitely purchase at this location again.",

Took it back to home depot and also brought my cabinets in with me and explained the situation to Ken Nguey and Saksham. They quickly identified that I needed a much stronger staple gun to perform the repair so instead of charging me for one, they took one from the rental section and helped me repair my shelves on the spot as it required an air compressor which i didnt have access to either. My shelves are fully repaired now and I am extremely happy with the service I received. Keep up the good work guys!",

For those with disabilities it s a huge pain to go all the way around to one entrance. It makes more sense to have multiple entrances to welcome people into the store.",

This branch is a mini store because the local authority doesnt allow them to sell lumber, drywall etc.  However they still have most things. Of great importance is the quality of the team.  Matt is a man with no hair but he has a million good qualities of a gentleman and delivers exceptional customer service.  He walks and talks like a member of the Royal family.  Heiter is a kind and attentive  cashier who is mindful and caring for the company. Salvatore knows everything about everything in construction,  or it appears that way to customers.  He helps and guides equally well in tools, electrical, plumbing, tiling.  Its a pleasure to meet him. Thank you Home Depot.",

Centrally located at the Main Street intersection across from Simons, Home Depot - Park Royal carries a comprehensive array of quality products for all aspects of your home renovations conceived, and yet to be imagined. Update:  20th July 2022 Seasonal Outdoor Garden Centre: Home Depot at Park Royal Village has an Outdoor Garden Centre (open approx. early-April - September) which is located behind the store building.  Ample parking is available, in addition to carts for loading up flowers, plants, ceramic pots and supplies. I hadnt made a visit to H.D. Garden Centre since before Covid struck 2 years ago, but needed to replace an area of flower bed in back garden which had been planted, but which slugs had completely obliterated. The July Clearance has already begun but there are still very good quantities of ornamental Annuals, Perennials and Shrubs as well as a wide array of supplies (e.g., soil, fertilizer, slug bait [ yes, lol ;) ], patio ceramic pots and more) to be had. Awesome location, top-notch store and people. Highly recommended.",

                "review_text": "It was a great service with Canadian tire center! We had a nail on one of our rear tire. We went to costco, bigotire and Mr. lube to get opinions. We were told that we had to replace all 4 tires without even checking. But we just replace a brand new front tire a year ago and only drove less than 3000 Km since. Costco was the worst of all! They were so impatience and told us they had to replace all four tires because they had to be the same brands because they did not carry my tires brand. Their attitude was the worst!  Canadian tire was our last store to get opinion on.  Gensis, Nash and Steven were very helpful and Gensis was very patience with us. He explained a lot of things to us and help us understand the situation. After listening to our story, Gensis told us that they would first check if our tire was repairable then offered options if it was not.  Both Costco and Mr. Lube never even bothered to do what Canadian tire did. They just assumed that we had a nail and all our four tires were needed to be replaced. Gensis at Canadian tire is such a nice guy and a great supervisor/manager I assumed. He went an extra mile for the customer and put our best interest first! As a business owner myself, I really think it is hard to find a great employee like Gensis these days.  In the end, it turned out to be that our tire only needed a patch. It only cost us 70 dollar! At Costco, they quoted us for almost $3000 to replace all tires. We will for sure go back to Canadian for future replacement!  We would 100% recommend this Canadian tire center at Cambie.",

He took down all my details and told me to call him if I needed anything at all.  As someone who worked for two separate Canadian tires for about 3 years, Booth I appreciate you. Customer coming in frantically 30 mins before close? Likely underpaid/undervalued, and definitely overworked?

I go to the aisle and am wondering about something, and there is a staff member who explained everything I needed to know. I have my purchases, and go to check-out. I tell a young man I need help because of my damaged gift card. He says I will help you. He is fun and friendly, and BOOM everything is taken care of.

I came to see the two household appliances that were advertised and scored excellent buys. Brightly lit aisles and well stocked displays. The microwave oven section was half empty but I managed to find a boxed Cuisinart air fryer convention toaster oven in stock as advertised at 50% off along with an additional $50 discount at the checkout! Wow! I also purchased a magic bullet brand personal blender on sale for $29.95. This place is a wonderful store for incredible buys. I come often to purchase specials from their flyers when there are things we need. The staff are helpful and knowledgeable. They publish and distribute a flyer every week or every other week depending on the season. This place is advertised as an automotive store but it has so much more to offer with a great selection of housewares, sporting goods and making your home beautiful. Well worth a visit.",

The other CTs don t really do this so this one was great for that. One thing though is this one doesn t have any self checkout stations and there was a huge lineup and only one person jumped on to another cashier to help the one cashier for the longest time.

I was so lucky to get Connors service. He asked a couple of questions to make sure I did need to change the battery. He even took his time to test the battery for me. When I decided to change the battery, he recommended the reasonable one for me. He also offered me two options to replace it: let their machinists do that for me (charge 68$) or by myself. In order to save the money, I chose to do that by myself.  I asked Connor to lent me the tools and tried it. Unfortunately, it was not as simple as I thought and gave it up, and I turned to the machinists for help, but none of them were available at that moment and asked me to leave my car there and they might replace it tomorrow. I was so disappointed and turned to Connor for help again. By the rule, Connor is not allowed to replace the battery for me, but he still be so nice to stand beside and guide me how to do that properly. With his instructions, I finally replace my battery. To be honest, I bothered Connor so many times today, but he was so patient and offered me the best service all the time! Connor, thank you so much for saving my day!",

This year I got the Canadian Tire VIP card which was a fantastic deal. I feel bad when the survey asked if anyone made my visit special because I don t need anyone now. I walk through the doors, pull up my C.T. App and search for what I am looking for. Batteries (Isle 13), electrical Isle 56. And, more importantly they are right where the app says and always in stock. Take note Rona get organized or you will be out of business soon as you are hopeless at stock control and customer service.",

I called in before bringing in my car(flat tire) and was told by the representative that they have the exact same tire on location and provided me the latest time/day it will be finished. That day came and when I called to check if my car is ready, turned out they do not have the tire and will have to be ordered and shipped from a different location. At this point, I was given another day/time when it will be completed. I received a call saying my car is finished, I came back and the car is not ready nor is the tire even on location. No one seems to be taking ownership of the 2 mistakes with the exception of Genesis. He took ownership of the issue and provided me with creative solutions to have the car ready at the time I needed it by. He was able to have my car ready within a very short time frame. We (consumers) need more reps like Genesis. Service: Tires",

But the thing that put this shop over the top was when they did with my car when it was ready for pick up. See the photo. I mean how incredibly thoughtful...
