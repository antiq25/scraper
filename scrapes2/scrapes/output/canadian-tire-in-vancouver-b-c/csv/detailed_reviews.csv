We went to costco, bigotire and Mr. lube to get opinions. We were told that we had to replace all 4 tires without even checking. But we just replace a brand new front tire a year ago and only drove less than 3000 Km since. Costco was the worst of all! They were so impatience and told us they had to replace all four tires because they had to be the same brands because they did not carry my tires brand. Their attitude was the worst!  Canadian tire was our last store to get opinion on.  Gensis, Nash and Steven were very helpful and Gensis was very patience with us. He explained a lot of things to us and help us understand the situation. After listening to our story, Gensis told us that they would first check if our tire was repairable then offered options if it was not.  Both Costco and Mr. Lube never even bothered to do what Canadian tire did. They just assumed that we had a nail and all our four tires were needed to be replaced. Gensis at Canadian tire is such a nice guy and a great supervisor/manager I assumed. He went an extra mile for the customer and put our best interest first! As a business owner myself, I really think it is hard to find a great employee like Gensis these days.  In the end, it turned out to be that our tire only needed a patch. It only cost us 70 dollar! At Costco, they quoted us for almost $3000 to replace all tires. We will for sure go back to Canadian for future replacement!

I wanted to change my battery of my car today. I was so lucky to get Connors service. He asked a couple of questions to make sure I did need to change the battery. He even took his time to test the battery for me. When I decided to change the battery, he recommended the reasonable one for me. He also offered me two options to replace it: let their machinists do that for me (charge 68$) or by myself. In order to save the money, I chose to do that by myself.  I asked Connor to lent me the tools and tried it. Unfortunately, it was not as simple as I thought and gave it up, and I turned to the machinists for help, but none of them were available at that moment and asked me to leave my car there and they might replace it tomorrow. I was so disappointed and turned to Connor for help again. By the rule, Connor is not allowed to replace the battery for me, but he still be so nice to stand beside and guide me how to do that properly. With his instructions, I finally replace my battery.
