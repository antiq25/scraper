I was instructed that repairing a leaky faucet with a shower diverter issue would probably take up to 3 hrs. Guess what? Kevin, who visited my place today, took only 20 mins to get the job done. Whats more incredible is that my 2 month old sleeping baby didnt wake up at all while he was fixing the issue like 3 meters away from her with the washroom door closed. Knowing how she is sensitive to noises, this is truly amazing. My wife and I couldnt stop chitchatting about how fast, accurate, and silent he finished his job. Elafon Mechnical Ltd. will be my go-to company for a long time.",

They solved long standing problems that the last company could not figure out. I know because I witnessed it in person so it wasnt them just saying it. I also know that they are very particular about the employees who represent them and that is how they keep the standards so high. Big thumbs up.",

Evan is a person who helps out, gives and is fair in his business dealings.  Thats my impression).  You see, Evan met with me over the noon hour on a busy Friday and  provided useful advice in plain, everyday language to myself.  Up until meeting Evan, I was getting the run around (to put it mildly!) from other HVAC companies/contractors.  When I arrived at Elafon Mechanical I saw a busy office and obviously a very busy Evan.  Yet Evan carved out time, like a Good Samaritan, for me, took a look at the issue/problem including some pictures, a movie clip, written correspondence, an estimate and then gave me a straight-up, no nonsense clear assessment of the problem and an estimate of how long it would take to fix including exactly how many people would be required for the job, which was one technician (and he was right). With the knowledge he provided to me, I was able to use the same in assessing a fair price (i.e. time and materials eventually quoted to me aligned to a T with what Evan counselled).  Elafon Mechanical is a fine corporate citizen - Id add people can expect the same with Evan Lanaras at the helm.",

The issue was minor and had been going on for at least a month, and was more of a nuisance than anything. Elafon sent out a repair man to fix the sink, however the leak in fact was not only worse following his attempted repair, but was leaking constantly even when the tap was in off position. I had to call and report this to Elafon; they apologized and sent out an emergency repair order, then charged me for both visits. I was appalled! When I called the company to understand this additional charge, they claimed the new leak was a coincidence, denied their responsibility, and justified the charge. The workmanship was poor, and honestly, the sink was working better before the 2nd fix (in which they must have tightened things too much and the lever to the sink was extremely stiff). I had to have the tap replaced because of this. Please caution with this company! I advise you to seek out repairs elsewhere!",

Elafon s technician attended your suite on August 5th, where he found the source of the leak to be a loose spray head hose connection. The technical removed the spray head, cleaned, tightened, and tested and found no other issues at that time besides that your garburator was jammed, and after trying to clear the jam, he was not given authorization from you or your boyfriend to replace the garburator. August 10th, you made the phone call, and we dispatched a technician, and he found the leak to be coming from your actual faucet cartridge, a completely different leak from the original. He disassembled, cleaned, and restored it to service without further issues. From what Elafon determined, there were two different leaks and service calls. I would have credited the call if the second call were a warranty issue. Unfortunately, it was not. Sincerely Owner",

The first time around they serviced the unit, the technician said that if the problem persists they need to come back and take the unit off-premises for repair at their shops.  The second time they were called, it was with the understanding that they would take the unit off-premises for repair, like their technician had advised the first time.  However, they only changed the filter the second time around and never took the unit for repair.  They charged me close to $300 for changing a filter.  I complained about this and they never owned up to the fact that the initial technician had advised differently and they said that I had to pay the two hour minimum (all this for a filter change).  They claimed that the second technician took the unit apart for service, however according to my tenant who was present, he only changed the filter.  After a-lot of back and forth they gave me a $30 discount (so overly generous of them)!!!!!  DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY.

We had a major water problem with shower faucet and needed water shutoff to building to fix. I called on Tuesday they said they would come on Friday. They then called on Friday and said sorry well come on Monday. I called 3 times on Monday and they said the technician would come later. Never happened.. will not be using Elafon ever again.",
