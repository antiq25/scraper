The treadmills, weights, and squat racks are going to be manufactured by the same small handful of companies anyways. The draw back to this gym is as other reviews mentioned, overcrowding. If you logically think about it this location in comparison to other fitness worlds is positioned at the most lucrative spot. A transit and sky train intersection. It is an inevitability that there will be more people at this gym than other places. Once you do the cost benefit analysis, it s not all that surprising. The solution is simply to ask other people to swap in with you during workouts. Most are quite friendly thus not decline and once you get into the habit of this, your gym routine will be on schedule as usual in my personal experience. No delays.",

After 4pm youre in for chaos but if youre into that, you do you! Also, personal trainers are a whole new level. Gustavo Chivata was just an amazing trainer. He taught me good posture, breathing rythm, pacing myself, pairing machines with other workouts, and he was just so approachable. I really recommend the free session and I also took the 5 sessions, trust me it does make a difference. Gus was a breeze to work with and also spoke Spanish, which was a plus to me.",

Nicole is an exceptional personal trainer who is dedicated, knowledgeable, and always pushes me to my limits in a supportive and motivating way. She takes the time to understand my fitness goals and tailors each session to my needs, making sure that I get the most out of every workout. With her guidance, I have been able to make significant progress towards my fitness goals, and I feel stronger, more confident, and more energized than ever before. Nicole is also an excellent communicator and makes sure that I understand the rationale behind each exercise and the benefits it brings to my overall fitness. She has a wealth of knowledge and experience, and I always feel like Im learning something new and valuable during my workouts. Overall, I would highly recommend Nicole as a personal trainer to anyone looking to improve their fitness and overall well-being. She is a true professional who cares deeply about her clients and goes above and beyond to help them achieve their goals. Whether you live close by or from a far. Thank you, Nicole!",

The staff is very friendly and approachable if you have any questions and feedback on equipment etc. I would give this gym 4.5 stars only because they are missing a few key pieces of equipment but that s only if your the body builder kinda guy. But I did talk to them and they are planning on adding those pieces in the next couple years which is why I gave the 5 stars. One is the pendulum squat machine which is one of the best machines to add on your leg day to really focus on the quads better than any workout you can think of for the quads. The pendulum squat machine is very difficult to find in any gym so the fact that they re adding it is amazing. Another is a standing lateral raise machine, Some call it a Watson machine. Another is the standing T Bar Row, they do have the seated one, but it doesn t put you at the best angle but still workable. All in all a great gym if you can avoid the busy hours. Thank you Golds!!!",

It is an affordable gym with a decent variety of equipment. What makes this gym truly stand out are the employees. They put a smile on my face whenever I come to the gym and that is saying a lot since I usually arrive at 6am slightly sleepy and grumpy. Id like to give a big shout out to Benny. He is one of the friendliest people Ive ever met. He is very diligent, remembers everyones names and it is clear he is passionate about his job and the members of Fitness World. Although there are larger gyms in the area, the sense of community Fitness World creates in their gym is unbeatable. Thanks for making all of my workouts such a pleasant experience.",

I would also recommend getting a PT session from Alex. He was a fountain of knowledge, fixed issues that other PTs in previous gyms have completely missed, really pushed me as hard as I could and was super motivating the whole session. I am training for an Ironman and he was on it with the sports performance side. If I ever had any questions he was always available to message also. As cringe as it sounds, I honestly feel so much more confident and happier following only a couple of weeks working with Alex. He also helped with a nutrition plan (which has always been my weak point!). Thanks again Team! Mark",

I took the free session with no intention of signing up for a personal trainer, but G blew me away and I felt like all my goals could be achieved with his guidance. I was not disappointed. I had a goal of weight loss for my wedding, but also to gain strength and mobility for my own longevity and quality of life, as I have a physically demanding job. G has kept me focused and on track and I have been amazed with the results I have seen. Overall, not only have I lost weight and feel much more confident in myself, I also had no idea I could get so fit, lift so much weight, and feel so strong! G is a demanding trainer, our sessions together leave me feeling pushed to the limit and amazed at what I have achieved. If you are looking to take it easy look elsewhere. G will push you and you will see results and have a blast at the same time.  He is exceptionally enthusiastic and passionate about his work and it is infectious. He is always available for advice and guidance. I cannot recommend him highly enough and will never have another trainer, I will always train the G way! I thank him for him encouragement and belief in me.",

It can be quite busy at peak times, and I prefer to workout on the turf rooftop when it s nice out. There are currently low-intensity fitness classes with a sweet, helpful instructor. Everyone wears masks in every part of the gym. Happy I joined on the  Fit  membership and after checking out another location, this place will be my go-to.

Their commitment to member satisfaction shines through from the warm and professional welcome at reception to the personalized attention they offer. In the past, Ive experienced gyms where personal trainers appeared to lack expertise, and there was no higher authority to turn to for assistance. Fitness World Cambie, on the other hand, is a refreshing change. The trainers at this location are not just well-informed, but also incredibly supportive and enthusiastic, creating a comfortable and motivating environment for fitness enthusiasts (or newbies) across all levels. One of the standout features of this gym is the tight-knit family vibe and the sense of community they foster. Dylans approachability and his knack for remembering everyones names contribute to this welcoming atmosphere. This location exceeds expectations when it comes to essential factors a gym should have, offering a variety of classes, well-maintained equipment, excellent hygiene and ventilation, and spotless facilities. The diverse fitness options and genuine care demonstrated by the staff make this gym the ideal choice for anyone looking to improve their health and well-being. Whats more, if theres ever an issue, a quick word with Dylan usually resolves it without any fuss. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Fitness World Cambie for its unrivaled service, comprehensive facilities, and the exceptional approachability of the General Manager and team members, all while creating a warm, family-like atmosphere and a strong sense of community.",

My trainer Dylan Hunt was absolutely fantastic and always checks in on me when he sees me at the gym. This is a really busy gym but they make sure you feel a part of the community and everyone is super helpful. Big shout out to Dylan though, he made everything super easy to understand and gave me a great work out plan. I love catching up with him when I see him",

I have never had a workout that I didn t like. I turned 60 earlier this month, and have never been stronger in my life.  If you need a trainer, hire Kennth Lee.

From the moment I walked in, I was impressed by the welcoming and helpful attitude of the staff. Fred, the manager, who was especially helpful as he assisted me in signing up for my membership and pairing me with the perfect fitness trainer. I then was introduced to Annastasija, who has been nothing but amazing to work with. She designed a workout plan that was tailored to my fitness goals and made me look better than I have in months. Her expertise and knowledge was par none the best I have received compared to my past trainers. One thing that stands out about this location is the cleanliness of the gym. The equipment is always in good condition and maintained properly, which is a rarity in most other gyms. I never have to worry about finding dirty machines or broken equipment, which can be frustrating in other places. Overall, I highly recommend this location to anyone looking for a gym that is near a skytrain and overall friendly staff and wanting to hit their fitness goals.",
