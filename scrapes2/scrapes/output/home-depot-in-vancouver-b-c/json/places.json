When I couldnt find the desired 24 x 48 corrugated plastic sheets due to their unavailability, Scott came to my rescue. Despite only having larger 48 x 96 sheets in stock, he willingly offered to cut one in half for me, even though I didnt have any tools with me. Scotts helpfulness was refreshing, especially after encountering three other unhelpful employees. As my young daughter astutely pointed out, Scott was the only staff member who made us feel truly welcome. The management team at Home Depot should acknowledge and appreciate employees like Scott, as his outstanding customer service sets an example for his peers to follow.",

I have been looking for a patio set for a while but couldnt find anything I like. Once I saw this set , I fell in love and wanted it in my home right away . My car was too small to fit the big box , Yak was able to arrange fast shipping, and I was able to get it the next day . I was not sure about this set, and Yak gave me his honest opinion. The set is high quality  and very comfortable.  I love it.  Thank you, Yak and his team.  Highly recommend homedepot, especially this location.",

Thank you so much to Glenn from the bottom of our heart; Glenn was kind, patient, and helpful everytime my father came into the store to ask questions. It was challenging for my father to converse and speak proper English as English isnt his first language . Glenn didnt just give simple replies; he listened patiently, researched several times and wasnt willing to give up. Finally, he was able to find the exact one for us and gave my father all the information he needed. Thank you for your outstanding customer service Glenn, my father has never met someone as dedicated to customers as you are. You really made his day! I hope your hard work doesnt go unnoticed by the management and the company. Home Depot is lucky to have an employee like you. Thank you thank you thank you we really appreciate you.",

The client called customer service to explain the situation. The returns staff Fred and Mostafa were absolutely amazing, professional, and efficient. Lester helped me move the items from my car to the store. I was in and out of there in less than 15 minutes!

I enjoyed the experience of purchasing with Home Depot. 10/10 would recommend and will definitely purchase at this location again.",

Took it back to home depot and also brought my cabinets in with me and explained the situation to Ken Nguey and Saksham. They quickly identified that I needed a much stronger staple gun to perform the repair so instead of charging me for one, they took one from the rental section and helped me repair my shelves on the spot as it required an air compressor which i didnt have access to either. My shelves are fully repaired now and I am extremely happy with the service I received. Keep up the good work guys!",

For those with disabilities it s a huge pain to go all the way around to one entrance. It makes more sense to have multiple entrances to welcome people into the store.",

This branch is a mini store because the local authority doesnt allow them to sell lumber, drywall etc.  However they still have most things. Of great importance is the quality of the team.  Matt is a man with no hair but he has a million good qualities of a gentleman and delivers exceptional customer service.  He walks and talks like a member of the Royal family.  Heiter is a kind and attentive  cashier who is mindful and caring for the company. Salvatore knows everything about everything in construction,  or it appears that way to customers.  He helps and guides equally well in tools, electrical, plumbing, tiling.  Its a pleasure to meet him. Thank you Home Depot.",

Centrally located at the Main Street intersection across from Simons, Home Depot - Park Royal carries a comprehensive array of quality products for all aspects of your home renovations conceived, and yet to be imagined. Update:  20th July 2022 Seasonal Outdoor Garden Centre: Home Depot at Park Royal Village has an Outdoor Garden Centre (open approx. early-April - September) which is located behind the store building.  Ample parking is available, in addition to carts for loading up flowers, plants, ceramic pots and supplies. I hadnt made a visit to H.D. Garden Centre since before Covid struck 2 years ago, but needed to replace an area of flower bed in back garden which had been planted, but which slugs had completely obliterated. The July Clearance has already begun but there are still very good quantities of ornamental Annuals, Perennials and Shrubs as well as a wide array of supplies (e.g., soil, fertilizer, slug bait [ yes, lol ;) ], patio ceramic pots and more) to be had. Awesome location, top-notch store and people. Highly recommended.",
